A custom ring light around a monitor, providing uniform lighting and custom color toning for video recordings and video meetings.
Made with RGB LED Pixels (WS2801), ESP32, MicroPython and Dear PyGUI.

### How it works

<a href="https://youtu.be/JpaI3x4-c7o"><img src="https://github.com/AltoRetrato/monitor-ring-light/blob/main/images/video_thumbnail.jpg?raw=true" alt="Video demonstration"></a>

A PC client sends data to an ESP32 board, which in turn controls a strip of LEDs assembled in a frame around the monitor.

The PC client is a Python script, using [Dear PyGui](https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui) for the GUI to set the LEDs color, and sending UDP packets to the ESP32 via Wi-Fi.

The ESP32 board (ESP32-DevKitC V4) has a [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/) firmware installed. A MicroPython script started after boot connects to the Wi-Fi access point, waits for UDP packets, parse the received packets and communicates with the LED strip via SPI to set the colors. A logic level converter is used since this LED strip requires 5V for data and clock but the ESP32 uses 3.3V. The system mighgt work without it, though - except for the 1st LED, which was flickering on my tests.

### Installation & setup

Obviously, check the details of your WS2801 LED strip before making any connections. I used the ESP32 hardware SPI pins:
* ðŸ”´ LED red cable: +5V
* ðŸ”µ LED blue cable: ground
* ðŸŸ¡ LED yellow cable (data): MOSI (ESP32 pin 13), though logic level converter
* ðŸŸ¢ LED green cable (clock): SCK  (ESP32 pin 14), though logic level converter

Download the files in the <a href="https://github.com/AltoRetrato/monitor-ring-light/tree/main/pc">pc</a> folder to your PC, and the files in the <a href="https://github.com/AltoRetrato/monitor-ring-light/tree/main/esp32">esp32</a> folder to your ESP32 (already with the MicroPython firmware).

Install Dear PyGui on your PC: `pip install dearpygui`

Reserve an IP address for your ESP32 on your DHCP server, or set a custom DHCP hostname for it.

Edit `ring_light_pc.py` on your PC to use the IP address or name of your ESP32.

### Usage

Run `ring_light_pc.py` on your PC.

Power up the ESP32 and LED strip. The LEDs should light up with the default color in a few seconds.

Use the PC client to select a color, and the LEDs should change immediately (as long as the ESP32 and PC are connected to the same Wi-Fi network). If you save the current color as default, the information is saved on the PC and on the ESP32.

Enjoy!

### Build

First I tested the concept on a protoboard with the ESP32 and just 3 LEDs. When the software and eletronics were done, I built the frame.

I used some letfover foam board to build the frame around the monitor, cutting holes for the LEDs with a compass cutter (see <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AltoRetrato/monitor-ring-light/main/images/foam_board_frame_and_compass_cutter.jpg">image 1</a> and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AltoRetrato/monitor-ring-light/main/images/frame_without_leds.jpg">image 2</a>).

Most LEDs fit snuggly in place, but a few might require a bit of glue. I didn't want to cut and solder 40 LEDs to space them as I wanted, so I just tied the cables a bit and left the remaining behind the frame for now (see <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AltoRetrato/monitor-ring-light/main/images/monitor_ring_light-back.jpg">image 3</a>).
